This is my first app based on the first RN task given.

I learned import, export, components class, styling, calling function/variable, conditional rendering, and how to render using AppRegistry.

I used Expo to view this app. So please download Expo app into your phone and scan the QR code in the QR.png. Please ensure that you are connected the same wifi: altheab2@unifibiz on your phone.

The code contains a conditional rendering which uses Math.random so if you click the button, there is 50% chance that you'll get an alert saying"You are cool!" or "You are awesome!". Click the button again and again for different results.



!-- UPDATE 1--!
Now i divided the content into 3 different view containers which each uses a different value of flex. I used justifyContent property so the content always floats in the middle. For the image i also used flex and resizeMode so i think it should fit.

!-- UPDATE 2--!
I have applied state into the button to change the alert shown. If the current state it says 'You are cool!' then the next alert shown will be 'You are awesome!' and vice versa.
